# Profile Photo Placeholder

**Please replace this README with your actual profile photo.**

## Instructions

1. Add your profile photo as `profile.jpg` in this directory (`assets/profile.jpg`)
2. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
   - The image will be automatically displayed as a circle on the website

## Current Status

The website is configured to load `assets/profile.jpg`. If the image is missing, it will show a broken image icon. Make sure to add your photo before deploying to GitHub Pages.
